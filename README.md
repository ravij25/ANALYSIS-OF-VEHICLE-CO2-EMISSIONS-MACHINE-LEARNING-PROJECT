INTRODUCTION
Background and significance of studying vehicle CO2 emissions
Studying vehicle CO2 emissions is of significant importance due to several reasons:
Climate Change Mitigation: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. The transportation sector, including cars, trucks, and airplanes, is a major contributor to CO2 emissions. By understanding and addressing vehicle CO2 emissions, we can take effective measures to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact.
International Commitments: Governments worldwide have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of international agreements like the Paris Agreement. Understanding and monitoring vehicle CO2 emissions is crucial for meeting these targets and fulfilling national climate commitments.
Health Impacts: Vehicle emissions not only contribute to climate change but also have direct health impacts. CO2 emissions are closely associated with the combustion of fossil fuels, which release pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants can lead to air pollution and adversely affect human health, causing respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other illnesses (Poole et al., 2019).
Energy Efficiency and Resource Conservation: Vehicles that emit lower levels of CO2 are typically more fuel-efficient. Studying CO2 emissions helps identify areas where improvements in vehicle design, fuel efficiency, and alternative fuels can be made. By reducing CO2 emissions, we can promote energy efficiency and conserve fossil fuel resources (Gerlagh et al., 2018).
Policy Development and Regulation: Understanding vehicle CO2 emissions provides a basis for developing effective policies and regulations to curb emissions. Governments can implement measures such as fuel economy standards, emissions testing programs, and incentives for low-emission vehicles based on accurate emission data (Mikler 2005, Yang et al., 2018).
Technological Advancements: Researching vehicle CO2 emissions drives innovation and encourages the development of cleaner and more sustainable technologies. By studying emissions, researchers can identify areas for improvement, such as hybrid and electric vehicle technology, alternative fuels, and intelligent transportation systems. This research contributes to the advancement of a greener and more sustainable transportation sector (Sang and Bekhet 2015).
When using machine learning techniques for analyzing vehicle CO2 emissions, various models can be employed, including regression models, decision trees, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. To evaluate the performance of these models, cross-validation techniques can be applied. Here are some references that discuss the use of these techniques for analyzing CO2 emissions in vehicles.
This report investigates the estimation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the road transportation sector by utilizing data mining methodologies such as linear regression and decision tree models. The study introduces a novel approach to predict CO2 emissions from passenger cars by employing an ensemble learning method that combines principal component analysis (PCA) with the AdaBoost algorithm. Specifically, the research focuses on forecasting CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles in urban areas using the XGBoost algorithm. The study sheds light on the application of XGBoost in the analysis of vehicle emissions within urban environments. Moreover, the paper proposes a methodology that combines machine-learning techniques, specifically decision trees, with vehicle simulation models to accurately estimate CO2 emissions from vehicles. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of decision tree models in predicting emissions, emphasizing their significance in this context.
The code was run on anaconda jupyter notebook using python version3.11.

Encoding categorical variables, 
Label encoding is a process of transforming categorical variables into numerical labels. In label encoding, each unique category in a categorical column is assigned a unique integer label. This allows the model to understand and process the categorical data as numerical values. For the current data set Make, Model, Vehicle Class, Transmission, and Fuel Type these columns assigned for label encoding.
Feature selection
For the multiple linear regression problem, the following features are considered as independent variables (X):
Vehicle Class
Engine Size (L)
Cylinders
Transmission
Fuel Type
Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)
Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km)
Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)
Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg)
The target variable (dependent variable) is:
*CO2 Emissions (g/km)
In multiple linear regression, the goal is to build a model that can estimate the CO2 emissions based on the given independent variables. The model will learn the relationships between these variables and CO2 emissions to make predictions. By selecting relevant features, the model can capture the significant factors that contribute to CO2 emissions and provide insights into the impact of vehicle characteristics and fuel consumption on emissions.

METRICS
In the context of evaluating a machine-learning model for CO2 emissions prediction, the following metrics are used:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual CO2 emissions. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the model's performance.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual CO2 emissions. Squaring the differences amplifies larger errors, making it more sensitive to outliers.
R-squared (RÂ²): R-squared represents the proportion of the variance in the target variable (CO2 emissions) that can be explained by the independent variables/features used in the model. It provides an indication of how well the model fits the data, with values ranging from 0 to 1. Higher RÂ² values indicate a better fit.
